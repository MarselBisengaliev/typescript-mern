# Project name - Marsel Notes

## Stack
In this project I used Typescript, MERN, Authorization through cookies, React Bootstrap for front-end and etc:
1. MERN stands for MongoDB, Express, React, Node, after the four key technologies that make up the stack.
2. TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.
3. Cookie authentication uses HTTP cookies to authenticate client requests and maintain session information.
4. Bootstrap is one of the most popular CSS frameworks out there. It is an open source collection of CSS, HTML, and JavaScript tools that helps developers minimize coding time when building websites and web pages.
5. Redux Toolkit is a set of tools that helps simplify Redux development. It includes utilities for creating and managing Redux stores, as well as for writing Redux actions and reducers. The Redux team recommends using Redux Toolkit anytime you need to use Redux.
